? Generating the sequential orthogonal design
? Sequential initial alternative is sequential and the next is chosen randomly from same 
? Number of rows is one we provide which might be changed if more rows are required

Design
;alts = alt1, alt2
;rows = 9
;orth = seq
;block = 3
;model:
U(alt1) = b0 + b1* Speed[20,30] + b2* Volume[0,1,2] + b3 * Lane[0,1] + b4 * Island[0,1] + b5 * Facility[0,1,2,3] /
U(alt2) =      b1* Speed        + b2* Volume        + b3 * Lane      + b4 * Island      + b5 * Facility
